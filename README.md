# Snap Event
An experimental Android app to generate calendar events from pictures of posters.

Works by detecting the text in the image and identifying important information such as the event title, date, and location.

Text detection is done using the [Text Recognition API](https://developers.google.com/vision/text-overview) of [Google Mobile Vision.](https://developers.google.com/vision/)
